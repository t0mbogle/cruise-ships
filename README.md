# Cruise Ships
Cruise Ships is a project where you can travel between an itinerary
of ports. The proejct uses primarily Javascript for the main setup and Jest as a testing framework. For the GUI aspects some HTML and CSS has been added.

## Description & Cruise Ship features
A Ship can 'Set Sail!' when the user pleases. The ship will travel between an itinerary of ports. The ship can set sail again from the next port when the user pleases. You user will be told via a message box details of the trip - current port, next port and whether the ship is leaving or arriving to or from` them.
<!-- Edit this after final GUI features have been implamented -->

## Authors & Acknowledgement
This is a project from the Software Engineering course by Manchester Codes.

## Roadmap
This project is still recieving updates to the GUI features. Ideas for future releases would include centering the camera, set sail and the message box as the ship moves. Additional images can be imported to make the GUI move appealing to the user. Text can reel off like a typewriter instead of being static.

## Project Status
Development for this project has slowed down but is still recieving updates to the GUI. Following that, further enhancements may be added in the future, stay tuned! :)
